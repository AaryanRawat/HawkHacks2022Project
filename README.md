# HawkHacks2022Project - Geodude Discord Bot

# Description
GeoGuesser is a fun game which went viral in the middle of the pandemic, but after having played for a long time, it started feeling tedious and boring. Our Discord bot tries to freshen up the stale air by providing a playlist of iconic locations in addendum to exciting trivia like movies and monuments for that extra hit of dopamine when you get the right answers!
